# 🍕 Restaurant Web Project

This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills as I work toward becoming a junior developer. It demonstrates my ability to turn a UI design into a fully functional, responsive web page.

### Design Inspiration 🎨
The page is based on this design:

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/8pdBuHbbbgA19qm3wg2r7V/Pizza-Restaurant-Web-Design-(Community)?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=wjQmgs8L5cnfvezX-0" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20Figma%20Design-Click%20Here-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma" alt="View Figma Design">
  </a>
</div>

Thank you for reviewing my project! I hope it reflects my enthusiasm and commitment to developing clean, user-focused websites.
